## Welcome!

Informed by an active and ongoing role in the open source and Drupal communities, as well as leadership deeply invested in transforming government, CivicActions is proud to showcase nearly 20 years of empowering people-first technology that benefits some of the most vulnerable populations.

We work with agencies like Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), among other predominantly civilian agencies that expand knowledge, healthcare, and resources for those in need. We believe that the guiding principles of open source software also inform our greater mission: to make the world a better, more equitable place that is accessible to all.

## Get Started

We are passionate about building an open source community. Reach out, contribute, and let’s build software openly and with gusto.

## Join us!

We believe people who are well taken care of can be more balanced, productive, and happy. Our mission is to help the government better serve the public by transforming the way digital services are built and delivered. We partner with agencies to modernize technology systems, improve user experiences, and build capacity for making government services accessible and effective for all.

We're looking for talented, compassionate and ambitious people who are ready to grow with us. [Join us!](https://civicactions.com/careers#open-positions)
